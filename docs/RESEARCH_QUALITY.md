# Research Output Quality Definition

This document defines what *high-quality research output* means in this system, independent of external access or tooling.

## Core Principle
Research quality is evaluated by **epistemic integrity**, not by volume of findings or external reach.

A research output may be *high quality even when it finds nothing*.

## What High-Quality Research Output Includes

A valid research result should demonstrate:

1. **Clear Problem Framing**
   - The problem is restated in precise, technical terms
   - Ambiguities are identified explicitly

2. **Landscape Awareness**
   - Identifies relevant dimensions (e.g., patterns, approaches, tradeoffs)
   - Distinguishes between known approaches and unknown areas

3. **Evidence Discipline**
   - Claims are proportional to evidence
   - Absence of evidence is stated plainly
   - No speculative synthesis presented as fact

4. **Provenance Integrity**
   - When sources are used, provenance is explicit
   - When no sources are available, provenance is empty (not fabricated)

5. **Actionable Next Steps**
   - Suggests what *would* be researched next if capability were expanded
   - Does not overreach into synthesis or implementation

---

## What High-Quality Research Output Does NOT Do

- Does not generate executable artifacts
- Does not imply completeness when evidence is partial
- Does not transition implicitly into design or synthesis

---

## Responsible Failure

A research output is considered **successful** if it:
- Clearly states that insufficient evidence is available
- Explains why (scope, access, novelty)
- Recommends constraints-aware next steps

Silence, filler, or speculative answers are considered *lower quality* than explicit insufficiency.
